# NeighborGigs — App Summary

**NeighborGigs is a hyperlocal, map-first app that lets neighbors help neighbors while they’re already on the move.**

Instead of posting generic gigs or waiting for workers, NeighborGigs focuses on **real-time availability**. Users who are already going out or heading home can broadcast their movement to nearby neighbors, who can quickly request small errands or favors within their neighborhood.

The app is built around **location, urgency, and trust**, not browsing or social feeds. Every interaction is constrained to a user’s neighborhood and radius, making help feel immediate, personal, and realistic.

NeighborGigs includes a native in-app wallet for earning and spending money. Phase 1 uses a custodial USD ledger. Blockchain/XPR settlement (if pursued) is Phase 2+ and not part of MVP.

At its core, NeighborGigs answers one question:


> “Is someone nearby, right now, who can help?”
